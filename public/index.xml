      <description>Abstract Since in late December 2019, the whole world started to report outbreaks of coronavirus which causes an enormous impact on both people’s health and life. In this report, I demonstrated the trend of Toronto COVID-19 data, and displays its distribution among people’s age, gender, etc. The data set is composed of 17590 confirm and probable cases reported by Toronto Public Health, containing geographic &amp;amp; demographic information. From data plot, I found that the amount of people get infected increased again on September, and females in aged 20-29 years old are more easier to be infected.</description>
